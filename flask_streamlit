⚖️ Streamlit vs Flask — Side-by-Side
Feature	Streamlit	Flask
Purpose	Build data apps quickly (dashboards, ML demos)	Build full web apps & APIs
Setup	Minimal — runs like a script	More setup: routes, templates, etc.
User Interface	Built-in UI components (st.text_input, st.button)	You need to write HTML, CSS (or use templates)
Use Case	Rapid ML prototyping, dashboards, visualizations	Production-grade web apps, REST APIs
Customizability	Limited (predefined layout and widgets)	Highly flexible (custom HTML, JS, CSS)
Learning Curve	Very easy (great for beginners)	Steeper curve (web development basics required)
Speed to Build	Very fast (few lines of code)	Slower — more boilerplate
Interactivity	Built-in (sliders, forms, live update)	Manual with JavaScript or templates

✅ When to Use:
Use Streamlit if:

You want a quick interface for ML/data projects

You don’t want to write HTML/CSS

You’re building an internal tool, demo, or dashboard

Use Flask if:

You need a custom website or REST API

You're integrating user authentication, databases, etc.

You want full control over layout and frontend

👨‍🔬 TL;DR:
Streamlit = great for data scientists

Flask = great for web developers
